-- | Serve static files, subject to a policy that can filter or
--   modify incoming URIs. The flow is:
--
--   incoming request URI ==> policies ==> exists? ==> respond
--
--   If any of the polices fail, or the file doesn't
--   exist, then the middleware gives up and calls the inner application.
--   If the file is found, the middleware chooses a content type based
--   on the file extension and returns the file contents as the response.
